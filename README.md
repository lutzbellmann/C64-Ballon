# C64-Ballon
The (almost) original "up, up and away" sprite tutorial from the C64 manual both in BASIC and Assembly.

# Instruction
Basic:
Load the "ballon_BASIC.prg" with
LOAD "BALLON_BASIC",8
RUN

Assembly:
Load the "ballon_ASM.prg" with
LOAD "BALLON_ASM",8,1
SYS2112

# Editing
The BASIC File can be directly edited in a simulator or on the Commodore 64 Computer.
The Assembly file *.asm can be edited in Turbo Macro Pro Assembler.

The "ballon_ASM.txt" file contains the readable menmonic of the assembler code. Can be used with cross assemblers for 6502. Depending on syntax convention of your cross assembler, changes may be needed.

# Have fun!
